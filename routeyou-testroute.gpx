    <name>Baudelostraat</name>
    <desc>If you stand back to back with the statue of Jacob of Artevelde, you look into the Baudelostraat. You can see beautiful fronts and gables along that street. This street was intentionaly constructed as a curved road, so one could see the houses from the market and the marvelous gables could lure you into the street. At the end of the 19th century, there was a plan  to make a shoppingstreet of the Baudelostraat. That is also the reason why the houses have a very large ground-floor. The function of that ground-floor was a shopping-space and the 1st and 2nd floor were the living spaces. Nevertheless, that plan never succeeded.&#13;
&#13;
The friday market has always been a commercial square and extending that function in the Baudelostraat, it was planned to strengthen the commercial position of the area.  150 worker-houses were removed to realize this plan. The architect "Semey" designed most of these beautiful houses. The plan failed completely. The actual trade and shops never came in this street. &#13;
&#13;
 A walk through this neighborhood tells us a lot about the mentality of the bourgeoisie of that time. You can read a lot of moralizing proverbs on many houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/2813.en"&gt;Vizit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/521.en?toptext=3910"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>

    <name>Pool of Peace</name>
    <desc>On the site of this now peaceful pond once stood the Spanbroek Mill - Spanbroekmolen in Dutch. The pond is a crater that was formed on 7 June 1917, the opening day of the great Mine Battle of Messines (a large part of which was also fought around the neighbouring village of Wijtschate). Twenty-three huge mines, containing tens of thousands of tons of explosive, had been dug under the German lines by the Allies. The plan was to detonate them all simultaneously at Zero Hour. 

This had taken years of preparation, much of the work being carried out by Australian mining companies. The tunnel leading to this mine was begun as early as 1 January 1916. It was 571 metres long and the mine chamber - where the explosive was packed - was more than 30 metres beneath the German trenches. The 42 ton charge of ammonal created a crater that was 76 metres wide and 12 metres deep. 

A small number of the mines failed to explode. In the months before the offensive, the Germans had carried out several successful counter-mining operations. This was one of the tunnels that they had discovered with their listening apparatus and they set off a camouflet - a counter-mine - to try and destroy it. Part of the roof collapsed and the Allied tunnelers had to work against the clock to get the mine ready again before the infantry attack. Here at Spanbroekmolen, they only managed to reconnect the charge on 6 June, the day before the infantry attack was due to start. 

The plan worked. 19 of the mines exploded, the German lines were destroyed and the Allied infantry was able to advance a number of kilometres, capturing the villages of Wijtschate and Messines (Mesen in Dutch).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/123417.en"&gt;Vl.

    <name>Monument Fergus Anderson</name>
    <desc>You're standing here in the middle of the village Buzet.

Buzet was part of the 'Circuit de Floreffe' motorcycle track, that was worldfamous between 1925 and 1956, the year that Fergus Anderson died.

The scotsman Fergus Kinloch Anderson (°1909) was one of the first British drivers who came to earn a living on the European mainland.

In 1950 he signed a contract with Moto Guzzi for the 250cc races, but quickly convinced Moto Guzzi to build a 350cc bike.

With this motorcycle, Anderson became world champion in 1953 and 1954, making of Moto Guzzi the first non-english brand that won the championship.  Anderson quit racing (at the age of 45 !) to become Moto Guzzi's team manager.  A dispute about the management led Anderson to quit the team and start racing again with the competing and ambitious BMW...

On april 29th, 1956, he was 'only' 4th on the Mettet Circuit.  He asked to change some minor issues to his motorcycle.  On may 6th, he started at the speed race at the street circuit of Floreffe.  A couple of miles from the finish, he slipped and crashed against the corner house of the Place de Buzet.  He died instantly &amp;ndash; although a person who witnessed the accident told me he died in a Namur Hospital.

Moto Guzzi's driver Bill Lomas won the race, but the Circuit de Floreffe was closed down.

Anderson wanted to be burried near the Circuit where he would die.  His grave can be found at the Belgrade Cemetery in Namur.

This commemorative plate was inaugurated 40 years after his death.

    <name>The castle of the dukes of Brabant</name>
    <desc>The castle of the dukes of Brabant has a long and eventful history. The building probably dates from the early 13th century. For centuries it served as a settlement and a hunting seat. The coat of arms of Maria van Zimmeren, Lady of Turnhout, is displayed above the entrance. A lawcourt has been established in the castle since 1796.&#13;
In the French era, noble families disappeared from the castle and dilapidation was inevitable. Around 1800 the French government started using the building as a court and as a prison, as deprivation of freedom became the common punishment. In 1807 the castle was sold to the City of Turnhout, which let it to the ministry of Justice. When in 1904 prisoners were moved to the new prison in Wezenstraat, the justice of the peace court moved to the castle. It became property of the province in 1908, which ordered architect Jules Taeymans to restore it. He gave the castle its current exterior appearance. It became property of the state in 1975. The Buildings Agency made a major effort to restore the whole back to its old lustre. Because of this, the Turnhout court is now established in a wonderful historic monument.&#13;
In the moat you can see the Naiad, the goddess of all springs and rivers. She settled down here in 1991. This is what Rik Poot imagined water nymphs from Greek mythology looked like.&#13;

    <name>Chapel Notre dame de la forêt</name>
    <desc>If you take the old path from Houffalize up to the edge of the woods, you will see one of the most beautiful religious buildings of the district, the Chapelle de Forêt chapel.It is located next to the old path that goes from Houffalize to Sommerain, at the edge of the wood called "Forêt". It is the object of a pilgrimage. This chapel is mentioned for the first time in Jean Thieskin's will that is dated from the 25th of March 1656 where he says he gives 50 florins if a chapel is built in honour of Our Lady in the Forêt wood. If the current chapel dates back to about 1750, and if it was rebuilt by Friar Fule Bechoux (a monk at the priory from Houffalize who also was the parish priest from Taverneux), the chapel might have built for the first time before 1656. The architect succeeded in giving it a Mosan aspect with its curved roof and with the onion-shaped domes that remind of the collegiate church from Dinant or the Town hall from Visé. The sanctuary is covered with slates that make drawings and it is a 18th-century-jewel that is unique in the province. (It was classed in 1975).The altar dates back to 1766, the panelling were put after 1768, nobody knows when the five paintings were put, and the iron-fencing in 1879.a restauration in 1993 gave it back its splendour of long ago, among others thanks to an outstanding work of the slates.The forest chapel is of hexagon shape and it is preceeded by a western-styled porch and that has an eastern-styled projection that gives the chapel the shape of a cross.The difference with the other religious buildings is are they are more long than large. This chapel is more central such as the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem or the Aya Sofia in Constantinople, the Carolingian Chapel in Aachen, and the Our Lady Chapel in Scherpenheuvel, albeit in Baroque style (Source: Maison du tourisme of Houffalize-La Roche).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/156117.en"&gt;Willem Vandenameele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/49088318.en?toptext=2802456"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>

Eurostat ranked the countries by adding the percentage of citizens who indicated they were happy ‘all of the time’ to the percentage of those who were happy ‘most of the time’ in the four weeks before the survey. Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland come out on top, as 76% of respondents claim to be happy in all four countries. However, Belgium is ranked first of those four with the most people who felt happy ‘all of the time’ (17.1%), compared to 15.3% in the Netherlands, 14.4% in Austria and 12.3% in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/10641.en"&gt;Pascal Brackman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/47407865.en?toptext=7342511"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>

    <name>Winter Garden Ursulines</name>
    <desc>In 1841, some Ursuline Sisters arrived in Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver to establish a school for working-class girls. Soon they also started a paying boarding school that gained international appeal. The architecture and layout of the buildings and the park bear witness to this magnificent past. Also today, 1700 students go to school.

The Art Nouveau winter garden from 1900 served as an elegant reception area for the visitors of the hundreds of resident girls. You will be amazed by the fairytale play of light and color of the dome and the original interior. Also discover the rest of the school and monastery complex with its monastery church, oratory, refectories, school museum, piano gallery and so many more unique locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/146169.en"&gt;Toerisme Provincie Antwerpen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/49394115.en?toptext=7374825"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>

    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The Grote Nete meanders beautifully through Hulshout and cuts the municipality in half, as it were, with the boroughs of Houtvenne and Westmeerbeek on the southern and Hulshout centre on the northern bank. The meadows along the Grote Nete provide numerous picturesque spots. You can go for a lovely walk in the Herenbossen domain forest. In the borough of Westmeerbeek you can admire the castle Ter Borcht (1780), formerly the spacious summer residence of the de 't Serclaes family. Also in Westmeerbeek you will find the Goor, a protected landscape with a typical fauna and flora.&lt;br/&gt;From 2013 onwards, Natuurpunt gradually started to develop a connected nature reserve 'Grote Netewoud' in the source area of the &lt;em&gt;Grote Nete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The limestone outcrop is a narrow band to the south of the Fagne-Famenne and consists almost exclusively of Upper Devonian limestone. It is like a step for the Ardennes. It is situated a lot higher than the Fagne-Famenne depression. The rivers from the Ardennes, which pass through this region, give rise to spectacular dissolution phenomena.

    <name>Dolmen of Solwaster</name>
    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The Solwaster dolmen is the name of a &lt;strong&gt;pseudo-dolmen located southwest&lt;/strong&gt; of the village of Solwaster in the Belgian province of Liège, in the High Pans forest area. The dolmen is a huge block of &lt;strong&gt;quartzite&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;has been partially excavated&lt;/strong&gt; . It is not far from the &lt;strong&gt;creek Statte.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stone was discovered by Théodore Britte in &lt;strong&gt;1887&lt;/strong&gt; . The environment was different then, there are no pine plantations like in the first decade of the 21st century, but a wild environment surrounded by deciduous trees and ferns that have infested everything. The finder reported the stone to Professor Elysée Harroy, who was interested in prehistory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the &lt;strong&gt;flat top&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;regular shape,&lt;/strong&gt; which also &lt;strong&gt;rests on other stones,&lt;/strong&gt; it is &lt;strong&gt;assumed&lt;/strong&gt; that it is a &lt;strong&gt;cover plate&lt;/strong&gt; and supporting stones of a megalithic dolmen. Along with a strange &lt;strong&gt;engraved sign&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;orientation direction&lt;/strong&gt; of the stone, it was given a meaning. The stone was then attacked with pickaxes to see how it balanced on the supporting stones below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2001&lt;/strong&gt; , years later, the stone had disappeared under a layer of humus and was &lt;strong&gt;dug up and replaced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholars strongly question the mythological function of the dolmen&lt;/strong&gt; , classifying the object as a pseudo-dolmen. Others believe that the mythological function would be further aided by other stones in a particular setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/156117.en"&gt;Willem Vandenameele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/52017435.en?toptext=8417593"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>

    <desc>&lt;p&gt;In full: Musée de la tapestry et des arts du tissu &lt;strong&gt;(TAPAT -&lt;/strong&gt; Museum of Tapestry and Weaving).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum is located in &lt;strong&gt;Huize Gorin from 1825.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luxuriant &lt;strong&gt;Tournai tapestries from the 15th and 16th centuries&lt;/strong&gt; confront &lt;strong&gt;contemporary work&lt;/strong&gt; by the Forces Murales group. Roger Somville, Edmond Debrunfaut and Louis Deltour were among them. The old tapestries hang downstairs, while the upper floor features recent work by contemporary artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the associated &lt;strong&gt;CRECIT workshop,&lt;/strong&gt; tapestries from all over the world are &lt;strong&gt;restored and new tapestries are made to order.&lt;/strong&gt; Research is also being done here into the dyeing and treatment of wool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tournai has a rich tradition&lt;/strong&gt; in textiles and weaving, and the museum plays a vital role in preserving and displaying this &lt;strong&gt;cultural heritage.&lt;/strong&gt; It offers insight into the techniques and skills used in the production of tapestries and textiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum is a must-visit for lovers of art, history and craft traditions. It offers an &lt;strong&gt;in-depth insight into the art of weaving and the beautiful textile artworks&lt;/strong&gt; created over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/156117.en"&gt;Willem Vandenameele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/52182816.en?toptext=8615893"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>

    <name>Cathedral of Our Lady</name>
    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The five towers of Tournai Cathedral give the building its extraordinary character, making it unique in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This striking ensemble consists of four angular towers arranged around a central fifth tower, in a geometric pattern similar to the five on a die, also called a &lt;em&gt;quincunx&lt;/em&gt; . All five towers are approximately the same height, around 83 meters, a harmonious height never equaled elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure symbolizes more than just architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Architecturally it was an innovative, Romanesque precursor, later even a source of inspiration for other churches, including the Dom Tower in Utrecht.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern of the five towers refers to both cosmic and Christian symbolism: it unites the Cross of St. Andrew (X-shape with the four corner towers and the central tower), the Greek cross (+-shape), and the idea of the Heavenly Jerusalem as described in the Revelation of John – a heavenly city, descended into the midst of the earthly realm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The towers themselves have names and each has its own function and history:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The middle one is called the Lantern Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Surrounding the tower are the Treille Tower, Pontoise Tower (with its heavy Marie-Pontoise bell), Johannes Tower (named after the St. John's Altar), and Brunin Tower (once a prison). Each tower has distinctive features, such as gilded sirens and banners bearing the city's coat of arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cathedral as a whole has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2000 and, together with the belfry, is an unmistakable landmark of Tournai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Americans are coming to visit it, but most Flemish people haven't seen it in Tongerlo yet: a beautiful and unique replica of the Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci. There is a strong suspicion that the master himself contributed to this replica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oooh my God!” Jean-Pierre Isbouts, professor emeritus at Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, California, exclaims when he stands face to face with the restored replica of &lt;em&gt;The Last Supper&lt;/em&gt;, based on the fresco by Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, in the abbey church of the Norbertines in Tongerlo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Today I am very happy that Belgium realizes it possesses a treasure. Because this replica of the original fresco that Da Vinci painted on the wall of the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan is also partly the work of the master himself. I have made a small contribution so that the world knows: Belgium has a Leonardo!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/user/view/1150116.en"&gt;Mediahuis België&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routeyou.com/location/view/47536516.en?toptext=9301582"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;</desc>
